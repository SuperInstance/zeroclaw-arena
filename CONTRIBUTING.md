## How to Contribute

### 1. Understand the Ternary Ethos

We use {-1, 0, +1} because it is the minimum viable alphabet for expressing agreement,
disagreement, and abstention. **0 is not "nothing"** — it is a deliberate neutral state.

### 2. Set Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperInstance/zeroclaw-arena.git
cd zeroclaw-arena
```

### 3. Code Standards

- **No unsafe code** unless absolutely necessary
- **Ternary-compatible** — prefer {-1, 0, +1} where appropriate
- **Test coverage** — every public function needs tests
- **Documentation** — all public items must have doc comments

### 4. Commit Messages
